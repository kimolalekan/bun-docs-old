bun is a new:

- JavaScript runtime with Web APIs like [`fetch`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch), [`WebSocket`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket), and several more built-in. bun embeds JavaScriptCore, which tends to be faster and more memory efficient than more popular engines like V8 (though harder to embed)
- JavaScript/TypeScript/JSX transpiler
- JavaScript & CSS bundler
- Task runner for package.json scripts
- npm-compatible package manager

All in one fast &amp; easy-to-use tool. Instead of 1,000 node_modules for development, you only need bun.

**bun is experimental software**. Join [bun’s Discord](https://bun.sh/discord) for help and have a look at [things that don’t work yet](caveats.md#not-implemented-yet).

Today, bun's primary focus is bun.js: bun's JavaScript runtime.
