### Types for bun.js (editor autocomplete)

The best docs right now are the TypeScript types in the [`bun-types`](types/bun/bun.d.ts) npm package. A docs site is coming soon.

To get autocomplete for bun.js types in your editor,

1. Install the `bun-types` npm package:

```bash
# yarn/npm/pnpm work too, "bun-types" is an ordinary npm package
bun add bun-types
```

2. Add this to your `tsconfig.json` or `jsconfig.json`:

```jsonc
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "lib": ["ESNext"],
    "module": "esnext",
    "target": "esnext",
    // "bun-types" is the important part
    "types": ["bun-types"]
  }
}
```

You can also [view the types here](./types/bun/bun.d.ts).
